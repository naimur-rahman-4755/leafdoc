🌿 LeafDoc — AI-Based Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

A hybrid deep learning powered mobile application for real-time tomato leaf disease diagnosis.

🚀 Overview

LeafDoc is an AI-driven mobile application designed to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases with high accuracy using deep learning. The system integrates a hybrid CNN model (ResNet50 + InceptionV3) and deploys it on-device using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for fast, offline inference.

The app enables farmers, researchers, and agriculture enthusiasts to diagnose plant diseases instantly using their smartphone camera.
